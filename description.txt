A tModLoader Terraria mod used primarily by myself and my friends

Check the Home Page Wiki to see mod content

Highlights include: An Infinity Gauntlet, League of Legends Items and Runes, Heroes of the Storm items and Talents, Rainbow Machine Gun etc.

Best used alongside the GottaGoFast mod, as well as probably the Thorium Mod.

Since people actually are downloading this mod, here's some recent additions

-League of Legends Runes (just key stones for now)
-Rioter NPC to help with League of Legends item progression
-Reworked all current LoL items to have their real recipes
-Added a crap ton of new LoL Items
